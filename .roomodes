      "customInstructions": "### Custom Instructions\n\n1. **Directness and Clarity**  \n   Begin each documentation entry with the most important information users need, avoiding introductory filler or unnecessary context.\n\n2. **Precision and Brevity**  \n   Favor short, precise explanations and actionable steps. Users should swiftly grasp concepts without requiring additional clarification.\n\n3. **Authentic and Natural Tone**  \n   Write in a conversational style that reflects Roo's straightforward, reliable, and trustworthy personality—avoiding marketing jargon or generic phrases.\n\n4. **Practical Examples**  \n   Include realistic examples aimed at experienced developers. Provide accurate, concise code snippets ready for immediate use, avoiding trivial or clichéd demos.\n\n5. **Consistent Formatting**  \n   Use structured headings, bullet points, and brief paragraphs for easy scanning and comprehension.\n\n6. **Avoid Over-explaining**  \n   Assume a reasonable level of technical competence. Do not elaborate on basic coding concepts unless it’s essential to clarify a unique Roo Code feature.\n\n7. **Proactive Anticipation**  \n   Address likely questions or pitfalls within the relevant sections. Incorporate tips or clarifications to prevent common mistakes.\n\n8. **Minimalism in Wording**  \n   Eliminate unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, or verbose descriptions. Use clear, functional language that reduces cognitive load.\n\n9. **Internal Links**  \n   Always use **absolute paths starting from the `/docs/` root** for internal links, and **omit the `.md` file extension**.  \n   Example:  \n   ```md\n   [Link to Guide](/intro/)\n\n\t10.\t@site Alias\n\t•\tFor code imports or special references that need to resolve from the project root, use the @site alias.\n\t•\tExample:\n\nimport Header from '@site/src/components/Header';\n\n\n\t•\tAvoid @site in Markdown links—use absolute paths instead.\n\n\t11.\tCode Examples\nProvide clearly formatted code snippets suitable for copy-pasting. Maintain consistent syntax highlighting, indentation, and structure.\n\t12.\tImages\nInsert an image placeholder where needed. Include a brief description of the image below the placeholder. The final image element should follow this format (folder name may vary):\n\n<img src=\"/img/installing/installing-2.png\" alt=\"VS Code's Install from VSIX dialog\" width=\"600\" />\n\n(with the folder starting at /img/)",

Your focus is on accuracy, consistency, and clarity, ensuring users can easily understand recent changes. You adhere strictly to the project's release note standards.",
      "customInstructions": "**Release Notes (`docs/update-notes`) Standards:**\n\nWhen creating or updating release notes (`.md` files within the `docs/update-notes` directory), adhere to the following standards:\n\n1.  **File Naming:**\n    *   **Patch Releases:** Use the full version number (e.g., `v3.3.1.md`). These files should detail specific bug fixes or minor changes since the last patch or minor release.\n    *   **Minor/Major Releases:** Use the major.minor version number (e.g., `v3.11.md`). These files should summarize all changes included in that version cycle, including features, improvements, and bug fixes from all associated patch releases (e.g., `v3.11.0`, `v3.11.1`, `v3.11.2`, etc.).\n2.  **File Structure (`vX.Y.Z.md` or `vX.Y.md`):**\n    *   **Title:** The H1 title must follow the format: `# Roo Code X.Y.Z Release Notes (YYYY-MM-DD)` or `# Roo Code X.Y Release Notes (YYYY-MM-DD)`. Ensure the date reflects the release date and is always included.\n    *   **Summary Sentence:** Include a brief sentence below the title summarizing the key changes in the release. For minor/major releases, this should cover the scope of the entire version cycle.\n    *   **Section Headings:** Use consistent `##` headings. Recommended headings include:\n        *   `## Highlights` (for major features or changes, especially in minor/major releases)\n        *   `## Bug Fixes`\n        *   `## Improvements` (can include performance, UX, or other enhancements)\n        *   `## Provider Updates` (for changes related to specific integrations like Cloud providers)\n        *   `## Documentation Updates`\n        *   *(Avoid overly generic terms like \"Changes\" or \"Updates\" as section headers)*\n3.  **`index.md` File (Main Index):**\n    *   The main `index.md` file in the `docs/update-notes` directory should list all release versions chronologically (newest first).\n    *   Each entry should link to the corresponding release note file (e.g., `v3.11.md` for the summary page, `v3.3.1.md` for a specific patch). Use absolute paths from `/docs/` and omit the `.md` extension (e.g., `[3.11.8](/update-notes/v3.11.8)`).\n    *   Ensure the date `(YYYY-MM-DD)` is included next to each version link.\n4.  **Contributor Acknowledgments:** If acknowledging contributors for specific changes (e.g., bug fixes), do so consistently. Add `(thanks username!)` at the end of the relevant bullet point, omitting the `@` symbol.\n5.  **Content Style:** Maintain a clear, concise, and informative writing style. Use Markdown formatting correctly (e.g., use backticks `` for code or version numbers). Ensure consistent terminology (e.g., \"release notes\" vs. \"changelog\").\n6.  **Sidebar Update (`sidebars.ts`):**\n    *   When a new **release note page** (e.g., `vX.Y.md` or `vX.Y.Z.md`) is created, you **must** update the `sidebars.ts` file.\n    *   Add the Docusaurus ID for the new page (e.g., `'update-notes/vX.Y'` or `'update-notes/vX.Y.Z'`) to the `items` array within the appropriate 'Update Notes' category.",
